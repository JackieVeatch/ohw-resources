# Logistics Overview

Some of you will participate in person at the [Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences](https://www.bigelow.org/) in Maine (US), and others will participate virtually from time zones all over the world. As we have learned throughout the pandemic, each of these gathering styles has strengths and weaknesses. We are committed to providing an engaging and full experience for everyone and will strive to facilitate cross communication and collaboration across all participants.

## Time

OceanHackWeek 2021 will take place August 3-6. *Pre-hackweek OPTIONAL sessions* will be on July 29-30 as a 1-hour session each day.

**In-person participants** will gather for full days, 9am - 5pm EDT. While **virtual participants** may choose to engage primarily with this group and schedule via Zoom and Slack, we strongly encourage you to join the program designed specifically as a virtual event. The virtual event will be split into two schedules and groups based on the distribution of participant time zones, in a 3-hour daily block of formal, live activities. The **larger virtual event** will take place 11:00am - 2:00pm PDT / 18:00 - 21:00 UTC, *except the first day when we will start 30 minutes earlier*. The **“Oceania” virtual event** is intended to accommodate participants from Australia to India and will take place 12:00pm - 3:00pm AEST / 2:00 - 5:00 UTC. You will be asked to choose between the two virtual groups.

Detailed schedules are available [Schedule page](../schedule.md).

## Channel of communication: Slack

We will use the [OceanHackWeek Slack workspace](http://oceanhackweek.slack.com/) as the main channel of communication before, during, and after the hackweek. You should have received an invitation to join this workspace. If you haven't seen it in your inbox, check your spam folder, or email us at *oceanhkw@uw.edu*.

[Go directly from a channel or direct message chat into a voice or video chat](https://slack.com/help/articles/216771908-Make-calls-in-Slack), with screen-sharing capability. This will be particularly useful during hack project time.
